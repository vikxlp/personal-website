Welcome to my new Hugo-powered website! I've moved from Framer to Hugo + Netlify for a faster, more customizable experience.

## Why Hugo?

I chose Hugo for several reasons:

- **Speed**: Hugo is incredibly fast, building sites in milliseconds
- **Simplicity**: Markdown-based content makes writing easy
- **Flexibility**: Full control over the design and functionality
- **No runtime dependencies**: Static sites are secure and fast

## What's Next?

I'll be migrating my content from the old site and sharing more posts about:

- Web development
- Photography
- Tools and workflows I use
- Tech tutorials and tips

Stay tuned!
